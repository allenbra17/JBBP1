# Proposal
Our project is to uncover patterns in fuel consumption depending on varying controllable factors. We will show The differences in car makes, year built as well as mechanical and model sizes.
We want to uncover the best miles per gallon based upon these metrics.
The outcomes that we found were not suprising, due to the nature of aerodynamics, and whether or not the car was built more for speed or consumer value.
