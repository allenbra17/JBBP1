## Proposal:
Our project is to uncover patterns in fuel consumption depending on varying controllable factors. We will show The differences in car makes, year built as well as mechanical and model sizes. We want to uncover the best miles per gallon based upon these metrics. The outcomes that we found were not suprising, due to the nature of aerodynamics, and whether or not the car was built more for speed or consumer value.

## Questions Uncovered:
How do different car makes stack up against each other concerning fuel mileage?

How does a vechicle's horsepower and torque compared to it's drivetrain?

How does a vechicle's drivetrain affect it's fuel efficiency?

How does fuel efficentcy change through time?

How does the size(volume) of the car affect the fuel efficiency?

How does a vechicle's price stack up against it's fuel efficiency?

How does the fuel type affect fuel efficiency?

## Data: 

For our research we selected two CSV files from Dataworld. These can be found in the 'CSV_Files' folder.

## Limitations:

Our finding are not in totalality for every make, year, and model. Only of those found within our CSV.
